intro: Bright white walls and those cobalt blue doors - idyllic Mykonos is the holiday island just a short plane ride away that delivers all it promises, and a little bit more. The unspoiled island dubbed ‘the little sister of Ibiza’ serves you just the right balance of sun soaked holiday bliss, old town charm and sunset dancing to Greek house music. Just guess what my Spotify list is now ﬁlled with. But what to wear après-beach and after the city streets have been explored?

      <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">Kalogera</h3>
      <p class="p--light">For an afternoon in the charming old town, opt for a pair of comfortable shoes, but no need for sneakers as the neat walking streets won’t have you balancing on cobblestones. Get lost in the small streets and let your eyes wander through the offerings of handmade jewellery, locally crafted leather sandals and embroidered, linen blouses. Make sure you ﬁnd the street named Kalogera, where you’ll ﬁnd local designer goods and a long list of new brands to put on your radar. Also visit the wonderful Cosset for interiors that make you want to give your home a Mykonos make-over.</p>
      <p class="p--light">The island is a lesser known hot spot for lavish yacht owners and luxurious hotel guests, meaning you are more likely to rub elbows with your favourite actress than backpacking students. The designer shops disguised in the same white walls will let you know when you arrived to the city centre. The warm nights and streets blooming with bougainvillea had me feeling a little dolce vita, where a well ﬁtted lace dress worked wonders for a long dinner in the old town. Most street restaurants will lure you in with their charm, although I recommend ﬁnding Restaurant Familia, located in the middle of the old town.</p>

    <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">The Palladium Hotel</h3>
    <p class="p--light">As for the best place to stay, ﬁnd a boutique hotel where you’ll be able to enjoy the local food and idyllic surroundings to the max. Hidden away from the party crowd we stayed at The Palladium Hotel. Located on top of a hill ensured postcard-esque views with it being just a stone throw away from numerous beaches and charming Mediterranean restaurants that had us soaking up the iconic Mykonos life from the get-go.</p>

        <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">Travel Wardrobe</h3>
        <p class="p--light">This season’s occasion wear comes with dolce vita vibes and a relaxed, safari inspired feel. Dresses and jumpsuits are my go-to holiday pieces – easy, no-brainers when it comes to styling. Have them ironed upon arrival, and you’ll be able to get dressed in no time. A crispy white summer dress should be on everyone’s packing list as it will be your day-to-night number. Save it for the days when the lunch stretches out and you ﬁnd yourself spending more or less the whole day at the restaurant lounge, ending the night dancing around a bonﬁre. Mykonos has that effect on you.</p>
        <p class="p--light">Take on hotspots like Scorpios or Principauté in a simple dress; you can hide a bikini underneath and reserve the whole afternoon for swimming, sunbathing and exploring the great seafood with matching cocktails.</p>
