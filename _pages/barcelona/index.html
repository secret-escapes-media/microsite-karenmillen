      <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">Paseo de Gracia</h3>
      <p class="p--light">Probably Barcelona's most iconic street and definitely my favourite. Home to the best boutiques in the city, including Santa Eulalia – the luxury landmark of the city established in 1843, discover a curated collection of designer goods. They also produce their own magical signature perfumes, plus they have the most delightful champagne bar.</p>
      <p class="p--light">Casa Batllo is also situated on Paseo de Gracia, which of all the Gaudi attractions, is the one I absolutely wouldn't miss. Even as a resident, I have repetitively enjoyed wandering around this curiously designed house. It's a real Catalan treasure! I also love stopping at the famous Tenorio for a coffee or three: grab a seat outside or in their entrance for the best people-watching. </p>
      <p class="p--light">The best tapas can be found at El Nacional, tucked away on a quiet passage just off Paseo de Gracia; try the Tortilla de Patata, it’s my absolute favourite Spanish dish.</p>

      <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">Barceloneta</h3>
      <p class="p--light">What's a holiday without a beach? I couldn't recommend a lengthy walk down this boardwalk more fiercely. It's a stunning spot; best to go early in the morning to avoid the crowds that intensify as summer heats up. Make a pit stop at Surfhouse, home to the best smoothies in Barcelona. Or for something more sweet, the artisanal ice creams at Ice Box make for the perfect beach treat.</p>
      <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">El Borne</h3>
      <p class="p--light">A very historic neighbourhood, nestled between the beach and El Gotico, it's one of my preferred areas and less tourist-filled than others. I'd suggest using El Mercado del Borne as your starting point, a market in the centre of an enormous square where a few years ago all kinds of ancient ruins were discovered. History aside, the square offers all kinds of discoveries: from icy drinks on terraces dotted on every corner to quaint boutiques, flower shops and coffee spots. Nearby is Flax and Kale, Barcelona's most celebrated healthy restaurant. This is my absolute favourite restaurant in Barcelona – I have tried every single thing on the menu and it is all incredibly delicious. Don't miss this spot!</p>

    <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">The Fairmont</h3>
    <p class="p--light">Tucked away on the quieter, more charming side of Diagonal, this 5 star offers everything a resort would but right within the city centre. I could easily while away at least a few days at their gym, two enormous pools, spa and multiple restaurants. The hotel effortlessly fuses modern and traditional decor, which consistently spans their 11 floors. The views from my bedroom were breath-taking; the huge window positioned centre of the room showcased the city in all its beauty, from the beach to the chaos in between.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--tiny title--upper title--bolder title--expanded">Travel Wardrobe</h3>
          <p class="p--light">I tend to create a small capsule collection from my wardrobe: clothes within the same colour scheme that are comfortable and can be dressed up or down. Within this I pack wear-everywhere options: a mini dress, fluid tailoring and a white top. I also throw in a graphic city dress for all my laid-back moments.</p>
          <p class="p--light">Versatile but chic shoes are vital, too, and these strappy sandals are easy to wear and walk in, and go with everything. Sunglasses are my holiday wardrobe heroes and, as for handbags, I suggest compact smaller styles that can be worn close to the body. I'll also bring a bigger style for when I plan on shopping or shooting, with ample space for my purchases and camera equipment.</p>
